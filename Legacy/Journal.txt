GOAL:

Trying to get these scanners working in parralel, 8 epson
scanners in total. Apparently some wizard was able to get 
this working before but many people have failed afterwards,
including myself.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS:

Tried multithreading with python scripts on Linux and Windows,
first and most niave approach. It seems the backend of epson
scanners do not allow for shared global resources on the 
machine, or something to this effect.

Tried using docker containers to isolate a Scan.py script for 
each scanner, but I faced a similar issue with shared resources.

LXD live servers suck dont use them

CURRENT ATTEMPT:

Use QEMU/LVM virtual machne manager to assign a VM to each 
scanner. Used LXD before but had issues actually getting a
IPv4 connection, it's a headache.


NOTES FOR USING VIRT MANAGER:

1. Each USB scanner is assigned directly to the base VM, named scanner-base
2. scanner-base username is seedscanner and password is Seeds! All derivatives are same
3. scanner-base has no USB conenctions, eachsubsquent scanning machine attatched to one of 8 scanners
4. Some scanners may not have backlight or entirely fail on rare occasions, full restart of every VM and Host PC after power cycle on scanner (off then on)

HOW TO LAUNCH:

1. Launch "virt-manager" in Bash by typing just that in console
2. Double click executable, enter QR codes (scan up to 8, dont fiddle with them unless errors for some reason)
3. Click enter
4. Files saved in home/SeedScans

REWORKING SCANNER ID's:
1. Run scanimage -L for scanner ID's
2. Run "scanimage -d 'epsonscan2:Perfection V39/GT-S650:001:013:esci2:usb:ES010D:317'   --format=tiff --mode=Color --resolution 75 --source Flatbed > /dev/null
" with the ID (013) changed accordingly.

Disk space allocation of qcow2 disk images can be found with:
sudo bash -c 'du -h /var/lib/libvirt/images/*.qcow2'
